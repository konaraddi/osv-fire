## FAQ

#### 1. Why hasn't Omkar made any recent commits?

I may be learning how to implement some functionality (e.g. learning C/C++,
    using RF with tanks). My practice files are not pushed to this repository.
    <b>This repository is solely for code that should run on the OSV.</b>

#### 2. Why is there so little code? Is this all Omkar has done?
Please see the answer to [Question #1](https://github.com/konaraddio/OSV_Nav#1-why-hasnt-omkar-made-any-recent-commits).
