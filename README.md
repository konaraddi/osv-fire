The `OSV_Nav.ino` contains the code for the OSV. Add the following necessary
libraries before uploading:
1. enes100 (can be found on the [ELMS](https://myelms.umd.edu/courses/1223708/files/folder/Arduino%20Files))
2. Adafruit_MotorShield (check Sketch>Include Library>Recommended Libraries w/in
    the Arduino IDE)
3. Wire (check Sketch>Include Library>Recommended Libraries w/in
    the Arduino IDE)

##To-Do:
Write code for Milestone 5.
Finished implementing short-burst approach in moveTowardsPoint().

## FAQs

#### 1. Why hasn't Omkar made any recent commits?
I may be learning how to implement some functionality (e.g. learning C/C++).
My practice files are not pushed to this repository. <b>This repository is
solely for code that should run on the OSV.</b>

#### 2. Why is there so little code? Is this all Omkar has done?
Please see the answer to [Question #1](https://github.com/konaraddio/OSV_Nav#1-why-hasnt-omkar-made-any-recent-commits).
And most of coding is thinking.

#### 3. How do I run this code?
Download this using the green "Clone or download" button. Add the necessary
libraries to your /Arduino/library/ folder. Upload to OSV.

#### 4. Hmmm, something's not working. What should I do?
Message me (Omkar).
